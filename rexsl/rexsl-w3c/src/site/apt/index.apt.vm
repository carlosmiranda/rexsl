W3C Validator in Java

  It's simple (see {{{./apidocs-${releasedVersion}/}JavaDoc}} for more details):

+--
String xhtml = "<html><body><p>Hello, world!</p></body></html>";
ValidationResponse response = new ValidatorBuilder().html().validate(xhtml);
assert response.valid();
+--

  Similar mechanism for CSS:

+--
String css = "body { font-family: Arial; }";
ValidationResponse response = new ValidatorBuilder().css().validate(css);
assert response.valid();
+--

  This dependency you add to <<<pom.xml>>> (or download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/rexsl/rexsl-w3c/${releasedVersion}/}rexsl-w3c.jar}}):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.rexsl</groupId>
  <artifactId>rexsl-w3c</artifactId>
  <version>${releasedVersion}</version>
</dependency>
+--

  All events are logged through {{{http://www.slf4j.org/}slf4j}},
  using <<<"com.rexsl.w3c">>> logger.
  If you want to see them, just add proper binding to classpath,
  as explained in {{{http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html}SLF4J manual}}.
