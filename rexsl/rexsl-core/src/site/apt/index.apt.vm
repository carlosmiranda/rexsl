ReXSL core module

  There are two classes that you should use in your project (both
  of them are mandatory in all cases):
  {{{./apidocs/com/rexsl/core/RestfulServlet.html}<<<RestfulServlet>>>}} and
  {{{./apidocs/com/rexsl/core/XsltFilter.html}<<<XsltFilter>>>}}. Use them
  in <<<web.xml>>>:

+--
<filter>
  <filter-name>XsltFilter</filter-name>
  <filter-class>com.rexsl.core.XsltFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>XsltFilter</filter-name>
  <servlet-name>RestfulServlet</servlet-name>
  <dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
  <dispatcher>ERROR</dispatcher>
</filter-mapping>
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>RestfulServlet</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>com.rexsl.core.RestfulServlet</servlet-class>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>com.rexsl.PACKAGES</param-name>
    <param-value>com.example.foo</param-value>
  </init-param>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>RestfulServlet</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
+--

  {{{./apidocs/com/rexsl/core/RestfulServlet.html}<<<RestfulServlet>>>}} is
  responsible for handling of JAX-RS requests and converting your JAXB annotated
  classes into XML documents.

  {{{./apidocs/com/rexsl/core/XsltFilter.html}<<<XsltFilter>>>}} is converting
  XML output documents into XHTML when necessary.

  This is what you include into your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.rexsl</groupId>
  <artifactId>rexsl-core</artifactId>
  <version>${releasedVersion}</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
+--
