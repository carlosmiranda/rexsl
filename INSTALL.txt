===============================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

    To build the project you need the following:

   JDK 1.6
   Maven (>= 3.0.3)


Continuous Integration Configuration
------------------------------------

    Continuous Integration platform has to be configured to run
    "mvn deploy" on every commit. Besides that the platform has to
    have "settings.xml", "pubring.gpg", and "secring.gpg" files available
    near the project source code base. These files are not inside SVN
    repository for security reasons. They have to be provided by the CI
    platform owner (the project owner, in most cases). "settings.xml"
    file has to document connection settings to the sonatype repository
    and web deployment platform. For example (this is a complete example
    of "setting.xml" file):

    <settings>
     <profiles>
      <profile>
       <id>ci</id>
       <properties>
        <gpg.homedir>../../closures/</gpg.homedir>
        <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
        <gpg.passphrase>....</gpg.passphrase>
       </properties>
      </profile>
     </profiles>
     <servers>
      <server>
       <id>www.rexsl.com</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
      <server>
       <id>oss.sonatype.org</id>
       <username>....</username>
       <password>....</password>
      </server>
     </servers>
    </settings>

    At the moment the following goal is defined in our CI server:

    1) mvn clean deploy -e -Dci --settings ../../closures/settings.xml


How to release new version to Maven Central:
---------------------------------
    https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-8.ReleaseIt
    http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/staging-sect-managing-plugin.html

    1. Create a new ticket in Trac, explaining why you want to release
       a new version (for example see ticket #607)

    2. Create new branch

        svn cp ^/trunk ^/branches/ticket607 -m 'refs #607 - new branch' && svn sw ^/branches/ticket607

    3. Set new version:

        mvn versions:set

    4. Update all versions:

        mvn versions:use-latest-versions

    5. Update all changes/changes.xml files

    6. Commit your changes

        svn ci -m 'refs #607 - version up'

    7. Deploy to sonatype:

        rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/com/rexsl && mvn -Prexsl -Psonatype clean deploy

        Make sure that you have this profile in ~/.m2/settings.xml:

          <profile>
            <id>rexsl</id>
            <properties>
              <gpg.homedir>/code/gpg/rexsl</gpg.homedir>
              <gpg.keyname>...</gpg.keyname>
              <gpg.passphrase>...</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
          </profile>

    8. Copy your branch to tags:

        svn cp ^/branches/ticket607 ^/tags/rexsl-0.4.1 -m 'refs #607 - version 0.4.1 released to Maven Central'

    9. Set version back to SNAPSHOT:

        mvn versions:set
        svn ci -m 'refs #607 - version back to SNAPSHOT'

    10. Merge the branch back to TRUNK.

    11. Deploy site to Amazon S3 (in approx 4 hours):

        svn sw ^/tags/rexsl-0.4.1 && mvn -Psite -Prexsl clean install site-deploy

    12. Close the ticket as "fixed"

    That's it
