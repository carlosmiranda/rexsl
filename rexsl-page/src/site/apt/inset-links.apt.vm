Adding Default HATEOAS Links To JAX-RS Page

  It is a good practice in
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS}HATEOAS}} to have certain
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_relation}link relations}}
  between pages. There are a few default link relations that you
  may want to have in every page.
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/rexsl/page/inset/LinksInset.html}<<<LinksInset>>>}}
  simplifies them:

+--
@Inset.Default(LinksInset.class)
public abstract class BaseRs extends BaseResource {
  // other methods
}
+--

  The page will be rendered like this:

+--
<page>
  <links>
    <link rel="home" href="http://www.example.com/" />
    <link rel="self" href="http://www.example.com/some-path/" />
  </links>
</page>
+--

  It is recommended to use <<<LinksInset>>> for all websites.
