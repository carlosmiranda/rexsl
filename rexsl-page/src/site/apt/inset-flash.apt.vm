RESTful Flash Messages (via Cookies)

  "Flash message" is a message rendered to the user only once, right
  after she completes some operation. For example, after a form is
  submitted and processed, your website shows the same page where the form
  was filled, but with updated data. It is always convenient to show a
  short notification text to the user, informing her that the form
  was processed successfully (or not). This is how you do it with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/rexsl/page/inset/FlashInset.html}<<<FlashInset>>>}}:

+--
@Inset.Default(FlashInset.class)
public abstract class BaseRs extends BaseResource {
  // some other base methods
}
+--

  BaseRs is a parent of all your JAX-RS resources (suffixed with <<<Rs>>>,
  by convention). Now this is what happens in your concrete resource:

+--
@Path("/form")
public final class IndexRs extends BaseRs {
  @Path("/submit")
  @PUT
  public void submit(@FormParam("text") final String text) {
    throw FlashInset.forward(
      this.uriInfo().getBaseUriBuilder().clone().path("/form").build(),
      "your text was successfully saved",
      Level.INFO
    );
  }
}
+--

  <<<FlashInset.forward()>>> creates an instance of
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ws/rs/WebApplicationException.html}<<<WebApplicationException>>>}}
  that encapsulates a JAX-RS
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html}<<<Response>>>}}
  with a
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie}cookie}} in it. That cookie
  contains a
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32}Base32-encoded}}
  message and logging level provided to the
  <<<FlashInset.forward()>>> method. Besides that, the response contains
  an HTTP response code
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_303}"303 See Other"}} and a
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_location}<<<Location>>>}} header.

  When the next page is rendered the inset Base32-decodes the cookie and
  adds the following element to the page:

+--
<page>
  <flash>
    <message>your text was successfully saved</message>
    <level>INFO</level>
  </flash>
</page>
+--

  Besides that, a cookie gets destroyed by a new cookie with the same
  name but with an empty value. That's how we guarantee that the message
  is rendered only once to the end-user.
