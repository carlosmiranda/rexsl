RESTful XML Page Modeler

  With this module you can build REST XML responses much faster
  (provided you defined <<<MyPage>>> class already):

+--
@Path("/")
public class MainRs {
  @GET
  @Produces(MediaTypes.APPLICATION_XML)
  public MyPage front() {
    return new PageBuilder()
      .stylesheet("/xsl/front.xsl")
      .build(MyPage.class)
      .add(new JaxbBundle("score", 123));
  }
}
+--

  The response will look like:

+--
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='/xsl/front.xsl'?>
<page>
  <score>123</score>
</page>
+--

  Isn't it neat? :)
  Start reading from
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/rexsl/page/PageBuilder.html}<<<PageBuilder>>>}}.

  Since version 0.4.8 you can use "insets", which implement basic
  functionalities required by most web applications, including
  {{{./inset-flash.html}flash messages}},
  {{{./inset-links.html}default HATEOAS links}},
  {{{./inset-version.html}version data}}, and
  {{{./inset-oauth.html}OAuth authentication}}.

  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/rexsl/rexsl-page/${project.version}/rexsl-page-${project.version}.jar}rexsl-page-${project.version}.jar}}
  and add to classpath):
